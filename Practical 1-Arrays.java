// Q1) Write a Java program to calculate the average value of array elements 

// Q2) Writea Java program to find the index of an array element

int [] arr = {90, 77, 67, 55, 75, 57, 98, 17, 50, 23, 30, 100, 34, 75, 28, 43, 14, 52, 64, 13};
int x= 64 
int index 0f = getIndex0f(arr, x); // your function 

// Q3) Write a Java function to ind te common elements in two arrays: 

// Q4) Write a java program to add two matrices (2x2) of the same size: 

// Q5) Write a java program to compute the matrix product of two matrices: 
int m = 5, n = 5; 

double mat1[][] = new double [m][n];
double mat2[][] = new double [m][n];

//initiate the matrices at random 

double prod[][] = matProd(mat1, mat2);

//print prod 
// Q6) Write a Java program to find all the unique triplets such that sum of all the three elements [x,y,z(x ≤ y ≤ z)] equals a specified number. 

int [] arr = {-1,12,4,7},3,2,1,2,0,1,5};

int x = 5 

int [][] ans = getTriples(arr, target); // your code 

//print ans 

// Q7) Write your own class to wrap an array. Demonstrate iteration by implementing the interable interface 

public class MyArray<T> implements Iterable<T> {

    private T
}
// Q8) Write a Java program to find contiguous subarray within a given array of integers which has the largest sum. In computer science, the maximum sub subarray problem is the task of finding a contiguous subarray with the largest sum, within a given one-dimensional array A[1...n] of numbers. Formally, the task is to find indices and with, such that the sum is as large as possible. Example: input: int[] A= 1,2,-3,-4,0,6,7,8,9 Output: The largest sum of contiguous sub-array: 30 
// Q9) Write a Java program to find the Longest Bitonic Subarray in a given array. A bitonic aubarray is a subarray of a given array where elements are first-sorted in increasing order, then in decreasing order. A strictly increasing or strictly decreasing subarray is also accepted as bitonic subarray. 
// Q10) Write a Java program to shuffle a given array of integers
